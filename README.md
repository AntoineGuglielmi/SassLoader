# SassLoader
I walways loved sass. But I didn't like to add each new file path/to/_whatever.sass file in my main.sass file.  
So I created SassLoader, a little and simple sass files caller which looks for all the files in a directory of your choice and add them to a drop point sass file with a "@import" rule.
